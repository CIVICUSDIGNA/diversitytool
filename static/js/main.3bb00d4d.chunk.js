Over the past year, <strong>CIVICUS tested the implementation of diverse and inclusive practices,and its impact on overall organisational health, through a one year pilot programme with different civil society actors</strong>. 8 CIVICUS members were selected from 400 applications with regional and contextual diversity. Once the pilot programme participants were selected CIVICUS matched each organization with an external consultant to undergo a diversity and inclusion audit. The audit was designed to be a stock taking exercise: looking what the organisation already has in terms of inclusive policies and practices and what glaring gaps need to be addressed. Each organisation received a comprehensive report identifying they were already doing well and recommendations on what they can improve with suggestions on how they can approach the gaps.",aboutParagraphTwo:"<strong>This report ended up being a huge driver of change for the organisations as many leadership teams had no idea that some of these problems existed.</strong> Even if they were somewhat aware of the issues, there was little awareness of how it was affecting their employees\u2019 well being and ability to do their job safely. After one year each organisation had taken great strides in implementing short term wins and long term structures. Many staff were able to see changes and co-created the desired change.

If you are pleased with the results, it might be an excellent opportunity to see in what ways some of your current practices could be further codified, standardized and institutionalized across policies and organisational key processes and practices. If you are disheartened - worry not. By the mere act of engaging in this self-assessment, you have already embarked on the journey of advocating for D&amp;I within your organisation - and perhaps sharing the results with colleagues is a good start in finding ways to address some of the issues you have identified.",aboutParagraphFive:"Wherever on the maturity model you find yourself at this point - we hope that you will continue working on improving D&amp;I standards within your organisation, holding yourself and colleagues accountable to these standards and values.
