      The first level of the maturity model; defined in comparative sense to
      other levels; denotes a lack of intentional or systemic approach to
      fostering D&I standards within an organization, and absence of D&I
      elements in the organization's management and work-processes. The
      "unaware" maturity level could also be called "we don't know what we don't
      know." At this level, a person or group hasn't yet started—even
      unintentionally—on their path towards maturity in that area.

      The second level of the maturity model; defined in comparative sense to
      other levels; denotes a practice in organizations, teams or movements
      whereby D&I standards are introduced on the basis of immediate or
      expressed demand (e.g. compliance with  existing regulations and laws).
      This level could be understood as an organization or a group having a
      nascent D&I strategy.

      The third level of the maturity model; defined in comparative sense to
      other levels; denotes a practice (types of behaviors/attitudes) in
      organizations, teams or movements that have some elements of D&I practice
      developed or deployed with a sense of awareness and intentionality,
      although not fully integrated throughout the work processes.

      The fourth level of the maturity model; defined in comparative sense to
      other levels; denotes a practice (types of behaviors/attitudes) in
      organizations, teams or movements that integrate a thoughtful, intentional
      and systemic strategy around various D&I considerations.

      The fifth level of the maturity model; defined in comparative sense to
      other levels; denotes a practice (types of behaviors/attitudes) in
      organizations, teams or movements that integrate a thoughtful, intentional
      and systemic strategy around various D&I considerations. The
      organizations, teams or movements in this level of maturity likely
      seriously approach and consider investments in D&I as one of the
      organizational priorities and can also serve as multipliers in promoting
      an advanced D&I practice among their stakeholders and in their
      communities. The defining factor of the "leading" category is that other
      organisations recognize this organization as an example to follow, so
      there is also an element of recognition and intentional aim to be a role
      model to others.
