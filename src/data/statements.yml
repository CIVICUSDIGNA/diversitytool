      If someone has specific requirements due to limited physical mobility
      (such as wheelchair access or some physical limitations) or different
      abilities, we do what we can to accommodate them and are willing to work
      with them to find solutions. For example, for those with limited mobility,
      we give them an office where they can access it. If we have someone with
      different visual ability levels, we remind everyone to communicate more
      vocally. Or we may use more written forms of communication if someone
      struggles with hearing.
