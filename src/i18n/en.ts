  welcomeTitle: 'Self-assessment tool on Diversity & Inclusion',
  welcomeDescription:
    'This tool assists civil society organisations and movements in their journey to become more inclusive, diverse and sensitive to the needs, identities and backgrounds of their people. We believe in peoples\' best intentions to reflect on themselves, their culture and practices, engaging in difficult dialogues when necessary. \n\nInteracting with this tool is not a panacea for solving discrimination, racism or workplace harassment. Rather, it provides a snapshot of where your organisation lies on the maturity model spectrum, with suggestions on how to grow in areas that need attention. It is not a rating or certification platform: we believe there is no "stamp of achievement" that an organisation can claim for "sufficient diversity."\n\nWe hope that this tool will support civil society organisations in becoming inspiring role-models and champions of diversity & inclusion in their communities, helping in the process our common mission of building a better, fairer, more socially just and kind world.',

  aboutSelfDiagnosticTool: 'About the Self-Diagnostic Tool',
  aboutParagraphOne:
    'There has been very little literature and case studies on the unique set up of civil society organisations to use as practical examples for the sector. Over the past year, <strong>CIVICUS tested the implementation of diverse and inclusive practices,and its impact on overall organisational health, through a one year pilot programme with different civil society actors</strong>. 8 CIVICUS members were selected from 400 applications with regional and contextual diversity. Once the pilot programme participants were selected CIVICUS matched each organization with an external consultant to undergo a diversity and inclusion audit. The audit was designed to be a stock taking exercise: looking what the organisation already has in terms of inclusive policies and practices and what glaring gaps need to be addressed. Each organisation received a comprehensive report identifying they were already doing well and recommendations on what they can improve with suggestions on how they can approach the gaps.',
  aboutParagraphTwo:
    '<strong>This report ended up being a huge driver of change for the organisations as many leadership teams had no idea that some of these problems existed.</strong> Even if they were somewhat aware of the issues, there was little awareness of how it was affecting their employees’ well being and ability to do their job safely. After one year each organisation had taken great strides in implementing short term wins and long term structures. Many staff were able to see changes and co-created the desired change. We hope with this tool, you will be able to find your D&amp;I driver of change and become inspired for positive change!',

  aboutParagraphThree:
    'Now that you have received your self-assessment results, it is time for a reminder: the process of developing, enhancing or consolidating your commitment to D&amp;I standards and principles is one that requires long-term commitment, and regular, recurrent self-examination and self-reflection.',
  aboutParagraphFour:
    'If you are surprised with the results - perhaps it would be an interesting and useful exercise to ask a colleague to fill out the self-assessment tool, so that you can cross-reference and compare your respective results, identifying in the process the causes behind eventual discrepancies. If you are pleased with the results, it might be an excellent opportunity to see in what ways some of your current practices could be further codified, standardized and institutionalized across policies and organisational key processes and practices. If you are disheartened - worry not. By the mere act of engaging in this self-assessment, you have already embarked on the journey of advocating for D&amp;I within your organisation - and perhaps sharing the results with colleagues is a good start in finding ways to address some of the issues you have identified.',
  aboutParagraphFive:
    'Wherever on the maturity model you find yourself at this point - we hope that you will continue working on improving D&amp;I standards within your organisation, holding yourself and colleagues accountable to these standards and values. Thank you for filling out the self-assessment tool, and for allowing us to assist you in your D&amp;I efforts.',
